`(DRAFT ONLY)`

Beginner's Sprint
-----------------
Self-guided work through weeks 3 & 4 of the training.digitalearthafrica.org course, followed by a use case looking at a SDG.

Change Detection
----------------
Teams will detect if and when land-clearing has happened within a given area, an generate mosaics of before and after the clearing event. 

Advanced: Time series forcasting of vegetation indices
------------------------------------------------------
Explore methods for short term time-series prediction of remote sensing vegetation indices. If scalable methods are 
discovered then this could lead to seasonal-based forecasts of vegetation condition; supporting broader attempts at 
ecological forecasting. The output of this sprint should be one or two functioning notebooks that perform accurate 
short-term predictions of a nominated vegetation index, along with an account of the methods that failed. This work 
will hopefully inform future efforts at ecological forecasting.


Advanced: Machine Learning Sprint
---------------------------------
The group will decide on a topic, and use training labels (possibly from Radiant Earth http://registry.mlhub.earth/) to train a model.
